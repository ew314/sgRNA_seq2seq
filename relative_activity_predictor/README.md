Relative activity predictor
================================

Relative activity data of single mismatched sgRNAs `Table_S8_machine_learning_input.txt` were downloaded from Marco[1].<br>
We basically followed the model architecture constructed by Marco[2].<br>
Pre-trained model and validation set are `NBT_react_model.h5` and in `val_seq`
