Relative activity predictor
================================

Relative activity data of single mismatched sgRNAs `Table_S8_machine_learning_input.txt` were downloaded from Marco https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00946-z.<br>
We basically followed the model architecture constructed by Marco https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41587-019-0387-5/MediaObjects/41587_2019_387_MOESM4_ESM.html. <br>
Pre-trained model and validation set are `NBT_react_model.h5` and in `val_seq`
